# VH7 Client

This is a work-in-progress future front-end for [VH7](https://vh7.uk/).

This is just in development phase at the moment and shouldn't be used for real. It's just here so people can see what is going on.

## The Plan

- It will be fully PWA compatible so that it works offline on mobile devices.
- It will eventually phase out the existing VH7 front-end. _<https://vh7.uk/> will redirect to <https://app.vh7.uk> where the app will be hosted. <https://vh7.uk/??> (short links) will redirect as normal unless pastes or uploads in which case they will redirect to <https://app.vh7.uk/view/??>._
- Dark theme!
- Better user experience than the existing janky front-end.
- Maybe official apps on Android and iOS???
